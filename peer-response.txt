"When viewing on a mobile device, the navigation menu rolls over and eventually takes up the whole screen before resizing. I think this takes up too much space and takes away from the main character information."

- Added a slicknav for a mobile menu on each web page.

"highlighting what page the user is on would make it more user friendly."

- Added a different text color to nav item when on that page.
